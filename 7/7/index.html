                Superman is a superhero who appears in American comic books published
                by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and
                artist Joe Shuster, and debuted in the comic book Action Comics #1
                (cover-dated June 1938 and published April 18, 1938).[1] Superman has
                been adapted to a number of other media, which includes radio serials,
                novels, films, television shows, theater, and video games. Superman
                was born on the fictional planet Krypton and was named Kal-El. As a
                baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments
                before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed
                in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He
                was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named
                him Clark Kent. Clark began developing his various superhuman powers
                and abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His
                adoptive parents advised him to use his powers for the benefit of
                humanity, and he decided to use his powers to fight crime. To protect
                his personal life, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the
                alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Clark resides in the fictional
                American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the
                Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love
                interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer
                Jimmy Olsen and editor-in-chief Perry White, and his enemies include
                Brainiac, General Zod, Darkseid, and his archenemy Lex Luthor.

            <p>
                Jurassic Park, later also referred to as Jurassic World,[1] is an
                American science fiction media franchise created by Michael Crichton
                and centered on a disastrous attempt to create a theme park of cloned
                dinosaurs. It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and Amblin
                Entertainment bought the rights to Crichton's novel Jurassic Park
                before it was published. The book was successful, as was Steven
                Spielberg's 1993 film adaptation. The film received a theatrical 3D
                re-release in 2013,[2] and was selected in 2018 for preservation in
                the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as
                being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". A 1995
                sequel novel, The Lost World, was followed by a film adaptation in
                1997. Subsequent films in the series from Jurassic Park III (2001)
                onward are not based on novels by Crichton.
